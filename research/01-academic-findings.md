## Neurobiological Mechanisms

### Source: NIH PMC10251362 - "Neurobiological risk factors for problematic social media use"

**Key findings:**

1. **Dopamine Pathway Hijacking**
   - Social media activates brain's reward circuitry (nucleus accumbens)
   - Increased dopamine secretion + decreased dopamine receptor availability
   - Same pattern as chemical addictions
   - "Variable rewards" (random likes, notifications) most addictive

2. **Prefrontal Cortex Immaturity**
   - Limbic system (reward/emotion) develops before prefrontal cortex (control)
   - Results in: weakened inhibition, high impulsivity
   - Adolescents/young adults most vulnerable
   - Structural changes: decreased grey matter in prefrontal regions

3. **Diagnostic Criteria (6 signs)**
   - Salience: Growing importance in value system
   - Compulsivity: Loss of control, time distortion
   - Tolerance: Need more time to achieve same effect
   - Withdrawal: Mood changes without access (anxiety, depression)
   - Conflict: Loss of other interests, lying about usage
   - Relapse: Failed attempts to control

4. **Autonomic Nervous System**
   - High sympathetic activity (stress response)
   - Chronic cortisol elevation
   - Decreased immune function
   - Sleep disorders common comorbidity

5. **Comorbidities**
   - Strong: Depression, ADHD
   - Moderate: Anxiety, OCD, social phobia
   - Also: Back pain, muscle strain, chronic pain syndromes

**Algorithm manipulation techniques:**
- Personalized recommendations based on engagement (not value)
- Autoplay features
- Infinite scroll
- Variable reward schedules (slot machine psychology)
- Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) exploitation
- Social validation loops (likes, comments)

### Source: Giedd (2020) - "Adolescent brain and the natural allure of digital media"

**Why adolescents are especially vulnerable:**
- Heightened reward sensitivity
- Peer approval critically important during this period
- Identity formation happens online
- Social media provides "social capital"

## Prevalence

- European average: 7.4% of adolescents
- High geographic variation: 5%-26%
- Higher in collectivist societies (Asia, Africa)
- COVID pandemic significantly increased rates

## Key Insight for Product Design

The paper distinguishes between:
1. **Adaptive intensive use** - High usage without negative consequences
2. **Problematic use** - Loss of control with negative life impacts

**This is crucial**: Our tool should help identify and reduce PROBLEMATIC use, not all use. Learning value vs. mindless consumption.
