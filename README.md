# YouTube Detox Extension

**Wean off YouTube addiction gradually, not cold turkey.**

A Chrome extension that helps you develop a healthier relationship with YouTube through awareness, friction, and gradual behavior change over 6-8 weeks.

## Why This Exists

Cold turkey doesn't work for most people. Blocking apps leads to:
- Workarounds and bypasses
- Guilt and shame cycles
- Binge-relapse patterns
- No lasting behavior change

This extension takes a different approach based on behavioral science:
1. **Observe** your patterns (Week 1-2)
2. **Become aware** of unconscious habits (Week 3-4)
3. **Add friction** to mindless consumption (Week 5-6)
4. **Replace** with healthier alternatives (Week 7-8)

## Core Features

- 📊 **Track everything** — Watch time, channels, how you got there
- 🤔 **Productivity prompts** — "Was this video valuable?" (builds self-awareness)
- 🐢 **Gradual friction** — Delays, confirmations, hidden recommendations
- 📈 **Progress visualization** — See your improvement over time
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** — All data stays local, no accounts, no tracking

## Research

This project is backed by academic research on:
- Dopamine and social media addiction (see `/research`)
- Nudge theory and choice architecture
- Variable-ratio reinforcement schedules
- Habit formation and breaking

## Status

🚧 **In Development**

## Philosophy

> "The goal is NOT to block YouTube. The goal is to make unconscious watching conscious, reduce mindless consumption to intentional use, and break automatic habits into deliberate choices."
